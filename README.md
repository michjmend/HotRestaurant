## Intro :pizza:

Here we built a Node / Express based web application for handling reservation requests.

Our application has two parts:
1. A front-end set of HTML/CSS/JS pages for entering and viewing data
2. A back-end composed of Node/Express and basic JS for storing, updating, and relaying reservation data.

## Our Home Page :house:

* On this page you are provided easy access our tables and reservations pages.
* You are also able to access the links to the stored arrays for the current reservations as well as the waitlist in a JSON format!

## Tables Page :book:

Here, you will see the Current Reservations and waiting list in a table format:

Table 1 | Input
------------- | -------------
ID:  | ID number
Name: | First and Last Name
Email | email@email.com
Phone: | (999) 999-9999

There is also a Control Panel where you can access the following links:
* Clear Table
  * Wipes all stored information
* API Table Link
  * Shows JSON of all current resevations
* API Wait List
  * Shows JSON of all wait list reservations

## Make Reservation Page :memo:

Here there will be a reservation form for the user to fill out.
Once you have inputted all your information, hit submit and your information will be stored! How cool!
The current tables API and waitlist API links are also included on this page.
